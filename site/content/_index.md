Trunk is a WASM web application bundler for Rust. Trunk uses a simple, optional-config pattern for building & bundling WASM, JS snippets & other assets (images, css, scss) via a source HTML file.

# Motivation

Any `wasm-bindgen`-based framework will work with Trunk. If you're new to [frontend development in Rust][], [Yew][] and [Leptos][] are two popular options.

[Leptos]: https://leptos.dev/

The easiest way to ensure that your application launches properly is to [setup your app as an executable][cargo-layout] with a standard `main` function:

[cargo-layout]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html

```rust
fn main() {
    // ... your app setup code here ...
}
```

Trunk uses a source HTML file to drive all asset building and bundling. Trunk also uses the official [dart-sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass), so let's get started with the following example. Copy this HTML to the root of your project's repo as `index.html`:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link data-trunk rel="scss" href="path/to/index.scss"/>
    <link data-trunk rel="rust"/>
  </head>
</html>
```

The `index.scss` file may be empty but must exist.

`trunk build` will produce the following HTML at `dist/index.html`, along with the compiled scss, WASM & the JS loader for the WASM:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/index-fe65950190f03c21.css" integrity="sha384-pgQCpTXf5Gd2g3bMQt/1fNJvznbtkReq/e3ooBAB1MPzHOTtbFDd5/tqXjQXrP4i"/>
    
<script type="module">
import init, * as bindings from '/my_program_name-905e0077a27c1ab6.js';
const wasm = await init('/my_program_name-905e0077a27c1ab6_bg.wasm');

window.wasmBindings = bindings;
dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("TrunkApplicationStarted", {detail: {wasm}}));

</script>
  <link rel="modulepreload" href="/my_program_name-905e0077a27c1ab6.js" crossorigin="anonymous" integrity="sha384-XtIBch5nbGDblQX/VKgj2jEZMDa5+UbPgVtEQp18GY63sZAFYf81ithX9iMSLbBn"><link rel="preload" href="/my_program_name-905e0077a27c1ab6_bg.wasm" crossorigin="anonymous" integrity="sha384-Mf9hhCJLbxzecZm30W8m15djd1Z1yamaa52XBF0TsvX0/qITABYRpsB5cVmy3lt/" as="fetch" type="application/wasm"></head>
</html>
```

The contents of your `dist` dir are now ready to be served on the web.
