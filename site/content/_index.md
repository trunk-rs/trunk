Trunk is a WASM web application bundler for Rust. Trunk uses a simple, optional-config pattern for building & bundling WASM, JS snippets & other assets (images, css, scss) via a source HTML file.

# Getting Started

## Install

First, install Trunk via one of the following options.

### Plain cargo

Download the sources and build them yourself:

```bash
cargo install --locked trunk
```

You can also toggle some features using the `--features` flag:

<dl>
<dt><code>rustls</code> (default)</dt><dd>Use rustls for client and server sockets</dd>
<dt><code>native-tls</code></dt><dd>Enable the use of the system native TLS stack for client sockets, and `openssl` for server sockets</dd>
<dt><code>update_check</code> (default)</dt><dd>Enable the update check on startup</dd>
</dl>

**NOTE:** If both `rustls` and `native-tls` are enabled, `rustls` will be used. You can disable the default `rustls` using
`--no-default-features`.

### Cargo binstall

You can download a released binary from GitHub releases through [`binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall).

```bash
cargo binstall trunk
```

### GitHub release download

Fetch and unpack a released binary from the [release page](https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/releases).

For example (be sure to check for the most recent version):

```bash
wget -qO- https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/releases/download/0.17.10/trunk-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz | tar -xzf-
```

### NixOS

```bash
nix-env -i trunk
```

### Brew

```bash
brew install trunk
```

## Additional tools

Any additional tools like `wasm-bindgen` and `wasm-opt` are automatically downloaded and managed by trunk. Therefore, no further steps required ðŸŽ‰.

**Note:** Until `wasm-bindgen` has pre-built binaries for Apple M1, M1 users will need to install `wasm-bindgen` manually.

```bash
cargo install --locked wasm-bindgen-cli
```

## App Setup

Any `wasm-bindgen`-based framework will work with Trunk. If you're new to [frontend development in Rust][], [Yew][] and [Leptos][] are two popular options.

[Yew]: https://yew.rs/
[Leptos]: https://leptos.dev/

The easiest way to ensure that your application launches properly is to [setup your app as an executable][cargo-layout] with a standard `main` function:

[cargo-layout]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html

```rust
fn main() {
    // ... your app setup code here ...
}
```

Trunk uses a source HTML file to drive all asset building and bundling. Trunk also uses the official [dart-sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass), so let's get started with the following example. Copy this HTML to the root of your project's repo as `index.html`:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link data-trunk rel="scss" href="path/to/index.scss"/>
  </head>
</html>
```

`trunk build` will produce the following HTML at `dist/index.html`, along with the compiled scss, WASM & the JS loader for the WASM:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/index-c920ca43256fdcb9.css">
    <link rel="preload" href="/index-7eeee8fa37b7636a_bg.wasm" as="fetch" type="application/wasm" crossorigin="">
    <link rel="modulepreload" href="/index-7eeee8fa37b7636a.js">
  </head>
  <body>
    <script type="module">
      import init, * as bindings from '/index-7eeee8fa37b7636a.js';
      window.wasmBindings = bindings;
      init('/index-7eeee8fa37b7636a_bg.wasm');
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

The contents of your `dist` dir are now ready to be served on the web.
