Trunk is a WASM web application bundler for Rust. Trunk uses a simple, optional-config pattern for building & bundling WASM, JS snippets & other assets (images, css, scss) via a source HTML file.

# Getting Started

## Install

First, install Trunk via one of the following options.

### Plain cargo

Download the sources and build them yourself:

```shell
cargo install --locked trunk
```

### Cargo binstall

You can download a released binary from GitHub releases through [`binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall).

```shell
cargo binstall trunk
```

### GitHub release download

Fetch and unpack a released binary from the [release page](https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/releases).

For example (be sure to check for the most recent version):

```shell
wget -qO- https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/releases/download/0.17.10/trunk-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz | tar -xzf-
```

### NixOS

**Note:** `trunk` is currently in the `unstable` channel. It should be part of the next release.

```shell
nix-env -i trunk
```

### Brew

```shell
brew install trunk
```

## Additional tools

Any additional tools like `wasm-bindgen` and `wasm-opt` are automatically downloaded and managed by trunk. Therefore, no further steps required ðŸŽ‰.

**Note:** Until `wasm-bindgen` has pre-built binaries for Apple M1, M1 users will need to install `wasm-bindgen` manually.

```shell
cargo install --locked wasm-bindgen-cli
```

## App Setup

Get setup with your favorite `wasm-bindgen` based framework. [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew) & [Seed](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed) are the most popular options today, but there are others. Trunk will work with any `wasm-bindgen` based framework. The easiest way to ensure that your application launches properly is to [setup your app as an executable](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html) with a standard `main` function:

```rust
fn main() {
    // ... your app setup code here ...
}
```

Trunk uses a source HTML file to drive all asset building and bundling. Trunk also uses the official [dart-sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass), so let's get started with the following example. Copy this HTML to the root of your project's repo as `index.html`:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link data-trunk rel="scss" href="path/to/index.scss"/>
  </head>
</html>
```

`trunk build` will produce the following HTML at `dist/index.html`, along with the compiled scss, WASM & the JS loader for the WASM:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/index-c920ca43256fdcb9.css">
    <link rel="preload" href="/index-7eeee8fa37b7636a_bg.wasm" as="fetch" type="application/wasm" crossorigin="">
    <link rel="modulepreload" href="/index-7eeee8fa37b7636a.js">
  </head>
  <body>
    <script type="module">
      import init, * as bindings from '/index-7eeee8fa37b7636a.js';
      window.wasmBindings = bindings;
      init('/index-7eeee8fa37b7636a_bg.wasm');
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

The contents of your `dist` dir are now ready to be served on the web.

## JavaScript interoperability

Trunk will create the necessary JavaScript code to bootstrap and run the WebAssembly based application. It will also
include all JavaScript snippets generated by `wasm-bindgen` for interfacing with JavaScript functionality.

By default, functions exported from Rust, using `wasm-bingen`, can be accessed in the JavaScript code through the global
variable `window.wasmBindings`. This behavior can be disabled, and the name can be customized.
