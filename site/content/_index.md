Trunk is a WASM web application bundler for Rust. Trunk uses a simple, optional-config pattern for building & bundling WASM, JS snippets & other assets (images, css, scss) via a source HTML file.

# Getting Started
## Install
First, install Trunk via one of the following options.
```bash
# Install via homebrew on Mac, Linux or Windows (WSL).
brew install trunk

# Install a release binary (great for CI).
# You will need to specify a value for ${VERSION}.
wget -qO- https://github.com/thedodd/trunk/releases/download/${VERSION}/trunk-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz | tar -xzf-

# Install via cargo.
cargo install --locked trunk
```
<small>Release binaries can be found on the [Github releases page](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk/releases).</small>

Any additional tools like `wasm-bindgen` and `wasm-opt` are automatically downloaded and managed by trunk. Therefore, no further steps required ðŸŽ‰.

## App Setup
Get setup with your favorite `wasm-bindgen` based framework. [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew) & [Seed](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed) are the most popular options today, but there are others. Trunk will work with any `wasm-bindgen` based framework. The easiest way to ensure that your application launches properly is to [setup your app as an executable](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html) with a standard `main` function:

```rust
fn main() {
    // ... your app setup code here ...
}
```

Trunk uses a source HTML file to drive all asset building and bundling. Trunk also ships with a [built-in sass/scss compiler](https://github.com/compass-rs/sass-rs), so let's get started with the following example. Copy this HTML to the root of your project's repo as `index.html`:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link data-trunk rel="scss" href="path/to/index.scss"/>
  </head>
</html>
```

`trunk build` will produce the following HTML at `dist/index.html`, along with the compiled scss, WASM & the JS loader for the WASM:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/index-c920ca43256fdcb9.css">
    <link rel="preload" href="/index-7eeee8fa37b7636a_bg.wasm" as="fetch" type="application/wasm" crossorigin="">
    <link rel="modulepreload" href="/index-7eeee8fa37b7636a.js">
  </head>
  <body>
    <script type="module">
      import init from '/index-7eeee8fa37b7636a.js';
      init('/index-7eeee8fa37b7636a_bg.wasm');
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

The contents of your `dist` dir are now ready to be served on the web.
