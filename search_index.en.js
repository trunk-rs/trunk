is a WASM web application bundler for Rust. Trunk uses a simple, optional-config pattern for building &amp; bundling WASM, JS snippets &amp; other assets (images, css, scss) via a source HTML file.\nGetting Started\nInstall\nFirst, install Trunk via one of the following options.\n# Install via homebrew on Mac, Linux or Windows (WSL).\nbrew install trunk\n\n# Install a release binary (great for CI).\n# You will need to specify a value for ${VERSION}.\nwget -qO- https://github.com/thedodd/trunk/releases/download/${VERSION}/trunk-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz | tar -xzf-\n\n# Install via cargo.\ncargo install --locked trunk\n# Until wasm-bindgen has pre-built binaries for Apple M1, M1 users will\n# need to install wasm-bindgen manually.\ncargo install --locked wasm-bindgen-cli\n\nRelease binaries can be found on the Github releases page.\nAny additional tools like wasm-bindgen and wasm-opt are automatically downloaded and managed by trunk. Therefore, no further steps required 🎉.\nApp Setup\nGet setup with your favorite wasm-bindgen based framework. Yew &amp; Seed are the most popular options today, but there are others. Trunk will work with any wasm-bindgen based framework. The easiest way to ensure that your application launches properly is to setup your app as an executable with a standard main function:\nfn main() {\n    // ... your app setup code here ...\n}\n\nTrunk uses a source HTML file to drive all asset building and bundling. Trunk also uses the official dart-sass, so let's get started with the following example.

All assets to be processed by Trunk must follow these three rules:\n\nMust be declared as a valid HTML link tag.\nMust have the attribute data-trunk.\nMust have the attribute rel=\"{type}\", where {type} is one of the asset types listed below.\n\nThis will typically look like: &lt;link data-trunk rel=\"{type}\" href=\"{path}\" ..other options here.. /&gt;. Each asset type described below specifies the required and optional attributes for its asset type. All &lt;link data-trunk .../&gt; HTML elements will be replaced with the output HTML of the associated pipeline.\nAsset Types\nrust\n✅ rel=\"rust\": Trunk will compile the specified Cargo project as WASM and load it. This is optional. If not specified, Trunk will look for a Cargo.toml in the parent directory of the source HTML file.\n\nhref: (optional) the path to the Cargo.toml of the Rust project. If a directory is specified, then Trunk will look for the Cargo.toml in the given directory. If no value is specified, then Trunk will look for a Cargo.toml in the parent directory of the source HTML file.\ndata-bin: (optional) the name of the binary to compile and load. If the Cargo project has multiple binaries, this value will be required for proper functionality.\ndata-type: (optional) specifies how the binary should be loaded into the project. Can be set to main or worker. main is the default. There can only be one main link. For workers a wasm-bindgen javascript wrapper and the wasm file (with _bg.wasm suffix) is created, named after the binary name (if provided) or project name. See one of the webworker examples on how to load them.\ndata-cargo-features: (optional) Space or comma separated list of cargo features to activate.\ndata-cargo-no-default-features: (optional) Disables the default Cargo features.\ndata-cargo-all-features: (optional) Enables all Cargo features.\n\nNeither compatible with data-cargo-features nor data-cargo-no-default-features.\n\n\ndata-wasm-opt: (optional) run wasm-opt with the set optimization level. The possible values are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, s, z or an empty value for wasm-opt's default. Set this option to 0 to disable wasm-opt explicitly. The values 1-4 are increasingly stronger optimization levels for speed. s and z (z means more optimization) optimize for binary size instead. Only used in --release mode.\ndata-keep-debug: (optional) instruct wasm-bindgen to preserve debug info in the final WASM output, even for --release mode. This may conflict with the use of wasm-opt, so to be sure, it is recommended to set data-wasm-opt=\"0\" when using this option.\ndata-no-demangle: (optional) instruct wasm-bindgen to not demangle Rust symbol names.\ndata-reference-types: (optional) instruct wasm-bindgen to enable reference types.\ndata-weak-refs: (optional) instruct wasm-bindgen to enable weak references.\ndata-typescript: (optional) instruct wasm-bindgen to output Typescript bindings. Defaults to false.\n\nsass/scss\n✅ rel=\"sass\" or rel=\"scss\": Trunk uses the official dart-sass for compilation. Just link to your sass files from your source HTML, and Trunk will handle the rest. This content is hashed for cache control. The href attribute must be included in the link pointing to the sass/scss file to be processed.\n\ndata-inline: (optional) this attribute will inline the compiled CSS from the SASS/SCSS fille into a &lt;style&gt; tag instead of using a &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\"&gt; tag.\n\ncss\n✅ rel=\"css\": Trunk will copy linked css files found in the source HTML without content modification. This content is hashed for cache control. The href attribute must be included in the link pointing to the css file to be processed.\n\nIn the future, Trunk will resolve local @imports, will handle minification (see trunk#7), and we may even look into a pattern where any CSS found in the source tree will be bundled, which would enable a nice zero-config \"component styles\" pattern. See trunk#3 for more details.\n\nicon\n✅ rel=\"icon\": Trunk will copy the icon image specified in the href attribute to the dist dir. This content is hashed for cache control.\ninline\n✅ rel=\"inline\": Trunk will inline the content of the file specified in the href attribute into index.html. This content is copied exactly, no hashing is performed.\n\ntype: (optional) either html, css, or js. If not present, the type is inferred by the file extension. css is wrapped in style tags, while\njs is wrapped in script tags.\n\ncopy-file\n✅ rel=\"copy-file\": Trunk will copy the file specified in the href attribute to the dist dir. This content is copied exactly, no hashing is performed.\ncopy-dir\n✅ rel=\"copy-dir\": Trunk will recursively copy the directory specified in the href attribute to the dist dir. This content is copied exactly, no hashing is performed.\nTrunk is still a young project, and new asset types will be added as we move forward. Keep an eye on trunk#3 for more information on planned asset types, implementation status, and please contribute to the discussion if you think something is missing.\nJS Snippets\nJS snippets generated from the wasm-bindgen JS snippets feature are automatically copied to the dist dir, hashed and ready to rock. No additional setup is required. Just use the feature in your application, and Trunk will take care of the rest.\nImages &amp; Other Resources\nImages and other resource types can be copied into the dist dir by adding a link like this to your source HTML: &lt;link data-trunk rel=\"copy-file\" href=\"path/to/image\"/&gt;. Any normal file type is supported. This will cause Trunk to find the target resource, and copy it to the dist dir unmodified. No hashing will be applied. The link itself will be removed from the HTML. To copy an entire directory of assets/images, you can use the following HTML: &lt;link data-trunk rel=\"copy-dir\" href=\"path/to/images-dir\"/&gt;.\nThis will allow your WASM application to reference images directly from the dist dir, and Trunk will ensure that the images are available in the dist dir to be served.\nNOTE: as Trunk continues to mature, we will find better ways to include images and other resources. Hashing content for cache control is great, we just need to find a nice pattern to work with images referenced in Rust components. Please contribute to the discussion over in trunk#9! See you there.\nDirectives\nYou can instruct Trunk to write the URL passed to --public-url to the HTML output by adding this to your &lt;head&gt;: &lt;base data-trunk-public-url/&gt;.\nTrunk will set the href attribute of the element to the public URL. This changes the behavior of relative URLs to be relative to the public URL instead of the current location.\nYou can also access this value at runtime using document.baseURI which is useful for apps that need to know the base URL on which they're hosted (e.g. for routing).\nHooks\nIf you find that you need Trunk to perform an additional build action that isn't supported directly, then Trunk's flexible hooks system can be used to launch external processes at various stages in the pipeline. Hooks can be declared exclusively in Trunk.toml, and consist of a stage, command and command_arguments:\n\nstage: (required) one of pre_build, build or post_build. It specifies when in Trunk's build pipeline the hook is executed.\ncommand: (required) the name or path to the desired executable.\ncommand_arguments: (optional, defaults to none) any arguments to be passed, in the given order, to the executable.\n\nAt the relevant point for each stage, all hooks for that stage are spawned simultaneously. After this, Trunk immediately waits for all the hooks to exit before proceeding, except in the case of the build stage, described further below.\nTrunk's build process\nThis is a brief overview of Trunk's build process for the purpose of describing when hooks are executed. Please note that the exact ordering may change in the future to add new features.\n\nStep 1 - Read and parse the HTML file.\nStep 2 - Produce a plan of all assets to be built.\nStep 3 - Build all assets in parallel.\nStep 4 - Finalize and write assets to staging directory.\nStep 5 - Write HTML to staging directory.\nStep 6 - Replace dist directory contents with staging directory contents.\n\nThe hook stages correspond to this as follows:\n\npre_build: takes place before step 1.\nbuild: takes place at the same time as step 3, executing in parallel with asset builds.\npost_build: takes place after step 5 and before step 6.\n\nHook Environment &amp; Execution\nAll hooks are executed using the same stdin and stdout as trunk. The executable is expected to return an error code of 0 to indicate success. Any other code will be treated as an error and terminate the build process. Additionally, the following environment variables are provided to the process:\n\nTRUNK_PROFILE: the build profile in use. Currently either debug or release.\nTRUNK_HTML_FILE: the full path to the HTML file (typically index.html in TRUNK_SOURCE_DIR) used by trunk.\nTRUNK_SOURCE_DIR: the full path to the source directory in use by Trunk. This is always the directory in which TRUNK_HTML_FILE resides.\nTRUNK_STAGING_DIR: the full path of the Trunk staging directory.\nTRUNK_DIST_DIR: the full path of the Trunk dist directory.\nTRUNK_PUBLIC_URL: the configured public URL for Trunk.\n\nAuto-Reload\nAs of v0.14.0, Trunk now ships with the ability to automatically reload your web app as the Trunk build pipeline completes.\n","id":"https://trunkrs.dev/assets/","title":"Assets"},"https://trunkrs.dev/blog/":{"body":"Blog\nWelcome to the Trunk blog!\nIf you are interested in creating content for the blog, please reach out to anyone on the Trunk maintainers team, we will be happy to work with you on creating some content.\n","id":"https://trunkrs.dev/blog/","title":"Blog"},"https://trunkrs.dev/blog/plugin-system/":{"body":"Hello again! For this post, I would like to share my thoughts on a few possible design patterns for a Trunk plugin system. We will review a subset of the possible patterns based on some community discussion so far, looking at pros, cons, limitations and other things to consider along the way.\nWhy Plugins?\nThe Trunk community has been discussing plans to introduce a plugin system for Trunk. A good question to ask is: why? There are definitely a few good reasons:\n\nThere is a lot more work to be done on Trunk, and plugins would allow for folks to quickly and easily integrate with the Trunk build system in ways which are not yet supported.\nProprietary integration. Perhaps folks have some Trunk pipelines they would like to build, but they are not able to open source the code. This would provide for such cases.\nPerhaps folks don't want to take the time to contribute 😬. The maintainers are too mean, too snarky, they always ask me to change things ... who knows?\nPerhaps the use case is too niche, and the Trunk maintainers don't think it should be in the code base.\nA big one is maintenance. As Trunk grows and new use cases inevitably emerge, that will be more and more code to maintain, which may slow overall progress of core Trunk development.\n\nTrunk Internals (abridged)\nTo have a meaningful discussion on possible Trunk plugin designs, let's take a quick look at the internals of Trunk. There are 3 primary layers:\n\nConfiguration: this includes Trunk.toml, env vars, &amp; CLI args/opts. These are merged based on a cascade and then fed into the lower layers.\nCLI Commands: this is what tells Trunk what to do.\nPipelines: all of the goodness of Trunk comes from the various pipelines we've created in this layer. This is where we process HTML, SASS/SCSS, CSS, images, JS, etc.\n\nPipelines\nThe entire build system is a composition of various asynchronous pipelines. The very first pipeline is the HTML pipeline. This directly corresponds to the source HTML file (typically the index.html), and this pipeline is responsible for spawning various other pipelines based on the directives found in the source HTML. As a reminder, Trunk uses the &lt;link data-trunk rel=\"{{TYPE}}\" ..args.. /&gt; pattern in the source HTML to declare asset pipelines which Trunk should process.\nEach pipeline is given all of the data found in its corresponding &lt;link&gt;, along with some additional general data, like config and such. This is then spawned off as an async task. Currently there are no dependencies between pipelines, however the HTML pipeline will not complete until all of its spawned pipelines have finished.\nUltimately, each pipeline can do whatever it needs to do, producing various artifacts and writing them to the Trunk staging directory. Once a pipeline finishes, it will return a manifest of data along with a callback. That callback is called by Trunk providing a mutable reference to the will-be final HTML, and that callback can update the HTML in whatever way it needs, which is typically just to remove its original link, and maybe append some new data which points to newly generated artifacts. Once all of the pipelines have completed, Trunk will perform a few final tasks to provide a nice pristine dist dir ready to be served to the web.\nSimply speaking, it could be said that Trunk is really just a system for running various sorts of pipelines/tasks which operate on an HTML document.\nEmbedded WASM Runtime\nOne pattern which is rather exciting would be to use an embedded WASM runtime like https://wasmer.io/ or https://wasmtime.dev/ as the basis for our plugin system.\nWe could define a WASM import/export interface where a WASM module may be loaded by Trunk, we query its Trunk ABI version, and then we call that module's main function (or whatever we decide to call it) and pass it a compatible data structure corresponding to the data which normal Trunk pipelines would receive.\nThose WASM plugin functions could return compatible data structures and manifests just like normal pipelines, and then we call another function on that WASM module, say callback, providing it HTML and then expecting HTML in response. This would be pretty damn close to the current pipeline system.\nPlugin Discovery\nPlugins could be declared in the Trunk.toml. A section of the TOML, say [plugins], would allow users to declare a module by name, along with some info on how to download the corresponding WASM. Trunk would fetch and cache these modules, and then modules could be selected for use in the source HTML via a &lt;link data-trunk rel=\"plugin\" data-plugin=\"{{NAME}}\" .../&gt; or the like. This would give Trunk a fairly robust mechanism for detecting that a directive should use a plugin, and we would also know the name of the plugin as provided by the data-plugin attr.\nI've considered perhaps leveraging https://wapm.io/ for this. Folks could use the WAPM registry for their Trunk plugins. Maybe we just allow folks to specify a URL (like the URL of an asset from a Github release) where Trunk can download the WASM module. Perhaps we support multiple patterns.\nCapability Attrs\nWhen a plugin is declared in the source HTML, attributes could be provided in the corresponding link which declare the \"capabilities\" which should be given to the plugin. Something like data-plugin-capabilities=\"capX,capY\", or perhaps something more granular. Various capabilities could be listed, giving the Trunk user full control over what the plugin can and can not do.\nHaving used many JS bundlers and build tools, many of which have their own plugin systems, I have very often been quite paranoid about not knowing EXACTLY what those plugins are doing. Lots of fun exploits out there. This seems like a great way to help mitigate such issues. Plugins could declare the capabilities they need, and Trunk can abort a pipeline early if the user has not provided the needed capabilities, helping to ensure users don't run into unexpected issues.\nThis seems quite nice. There are lots of additional features which could be developed along these lines. New Trunk capabilities could be exposed over time as we develop new features. I dig it.\nTrunk Plugin Lib\nAlong with this approach we would release a trunk-plugin crate which does everything for you. The only thing plugin authors would need to do is write the actual business logic of their plugin. Some of the things it would do:\n\nit would have cargo features for opting into the various capabilities which Trunk can expose to plugins, and would expose code to actually utilize those capabilities from within the plugin.\nopting into various capabilities would automatically update an exported WASM function to tell Trunk which capabilities the plugin needs.\nall of the WIT business would be taken care of by this crate. Authors would not have to worry about how to move data across the WASM boundary.\n\nPros\nOk, so let's recap the goodness.\n\nWASM gives us a universal runtime, so plugins could be written in any compatible WASM language (Rust, C, C++, Swift, Go, AssemblyScript, &amp;c).\nPlugins would only ever need to be compiled for one architecture: WASM.\nCapability-based security. If a plugin needs network or filesystem access, this might be a good time to go review the code in the plugin.\nThe Trunk maintainers would publish a crate to handle all of the heavy lifting related to creating plugins.\n\nCons\n\nBuilding capabilities will take time and deeper design work, though this will be true for any plugin system.\nWASM does not yet support async paradigms, so basically all plugins will need to be spawned onto an async threadpool. Not really a big deal.\nWe would be moving somewhat out of the happy and safe Rustacean tide pool and into the cold scary world of WASM, other package managers (potentially), and an unstable WASM/WASI/WIT set of specs ... though we are already a Rust WASM web bundler. Additionally, we would quite likely not use WASI at all, and instead expose our own set of capabilities.\n\nDynamic Linking (via Stable ABI)\nWe've looked into using abi_stable_crates. This would be Rust dynamic linking via a stable subset of the Rust ABI (provided by this crate, because Rust itself does not have a stable ABI), and then leveraging this crate's runtime logic to verify the safety of dynamically linking to the various plugins.\nWe would need our own discovery system for this, and plugins would need to be built by Trunk (most likely), as they would need to be built for the host tripple. There would be a fair bit of overhead with this approach. It would not be as rigid as C FFI, and it would still be safe Rust&lt;-&gt;Rust communication, but we would need to use a limited subset of types at the boundary.\nJust Don't\nWe could just not do a plugin system. There are already a few nice improvements we can make to the current process of adding new pipeline types. By my analysis, we should switch over to a dynamic dispatch model for the response data from pipelines. I only say this because the current approach uses enums (which I love), but folks unfamiliar with the code base may see this as tedious to update.\nThe process of adding new pipeline types is already pretty simple, we can make it even more simple. Perhaps this topic merits a blog post of its own.\nConclusion\nAll in all, I'm pretty stoked about the possibility of using a WASM runtime for Trunk plugins. The security improvements (over other plugin models) are real, the simplicity of distributing ready to execute WASM is real, I dig it.\nThere is some good discussion over in Trunk #104, and more discussion to be had. This blog post should be seen as part of that discussion. If you have thoughts or ideas on this topic, please drop by and share. We would love to hear from you!\nCheers!\n","id":"https://trunkrs.dev/blog/plugin-system/","title":"Design Thoughts — Trunk Plugin System"},"https://trunkrs.dev/blog/release-0-8-0/":{"body":"Hello fellow Rustaceans! Welcome to the very first official blog post of the Trunk community. In case you don't know, Trunk is a WASM web application bundler for Rust. It works out of the box with any web UI framework based on wasm-bindgen, and supports bundling of a good number of asset types including SASS/SCSS, CSS, JS snippets, images, and more. There's a lot to cover here, so let's dig in.\nNew Site &amp; New Blog\nFirst off, if you are reading this blog post, then you've found our new Trunk website. All of our documentation is here, and the maintainers team plans on continuing to expand this site, adding new documentation and improving the site as we go. This is a community driven website, so if you see things which you would like to improve, content you would like to add (including new blog posts), or any other sorts of changes, please open a PR! Just to make that process even easier, let's talk about how the site is built.\nWe are using the excellent Zola static site engine. It is another great Rust project. Putting together this entire site from nothing took only a few hours. Sure there's not too much here, but the quality is quite solid, and Zola really delivered on providing a robust development process. Using Zola to make changes to this site will be quite simple for newcomers and experienced users alike.\nWe are also using the Zola Juice theme. I have to say, I quite like the theme, and very few changes were needed to make things work.\nFor now we are using Github Pages to host the site. This was so quick and easy, there are Github Actions which do most of the heavy lifting. Hard to beat that level of convenience.\nOverall, adding a new blog post for maintainers and community members will typically be as simple as adding a new markdown file with your content ... AND THAT'S ALL. Doesn't get easier than that. It is the hope of the maintainers team that community members will feel empowered to write a blog post on anything and everything related to Trunk. Use cases, future plans for contributions, pain points, areas where they would like to see Trunk improve, how to use Trunk with Seed, Yew, or any other project. The more content the better.\nLast thing I will say about the site, we are in the process of adding some new art work. Right now we've got a placeholder Ferris holding down the fort. They're doing a great job, but we're looking for some Trunk specific art, images, Ferris logos, etc. We've got some discussion going on over in Trunk #120. I am especially excited about the possibility of an SVG of a bunch of little Ferris crabs packing a trunk full of sea shells, assets logos, scripts/scrolls, coral chunks and the like. If you've got some skills on this front, and you would like to jump on this hype train, DO IT!!! We would love to show off your skills on the site.\nNew Maintainers\nThe biggest news we have, and probably one of the best things for the Trunk project itself, is that we have 3 new maintainers!!! 🎉🍻 Rakshith Ravi, Philip Peterson and Martin Kavik. I'm very excited to have these guys on the team, they've each already contributed in many ways to the Trunk project, and having a strong group of maintainers is very important for the long-term success of any open source project. We are all stronger together!\nIf you are interested in helping out as a maintainer, the best way to get started is with PR reviews, reviewing issues and making sure they are ready to be moved to the coding phase, and then actually getting your hands dirty with some code! Trunk so far has been able to maintain a pretty solid and enjoyable code base. Now is a great time to get involved.\nTrunk v0.8.0 has Landed\nTrunk v0.8.0 has now been released. See the release page for all of the details. In summary:\n\nThe trunk watch &amp; trunk serve commands now accept the --watch option which allows users to specify multiple different directories and files to be watched, triggering new builds as changes are detected. A community member @malobre knocked this one out.\nAnother community member @DzenanJupic has added the inline asset type. This allows users to target various file types and have their content \"inlined\" into the parent HTML document as-is. Go checkout the docs on the inline asset type for more details (wow, felt great to be able to provide a link to the docs like that).\nA community member @hamza1311 &amp; one of our maintainers @philip-peterson squashed a bug where old build artifacts would continually accumulate in the dist dir. That has now been fixed, and any time a successful build goes through, all of the old artifacts will be removed, and only the fresh new artifacts will exist in the dist dir.\nLastly, @MartinKavik fixed an infinite rebuild loop bug on Windows.\n\nImmediate Plans\nIn the immediate term, we have a few community lead efforts for cutting Trunk over to the Tokio ecosystem. This is primarily to address our need for a robust WebSockets &amp; SSE solution, and the Tokio community happens to have some pretty solid options on that front.\nWe've also got another community lead effort on getting wasm-opt integrated into the standard Trunk build pipeline.\nBoth of these initiatives are exciting and will go far to provide an even better experience for folks building Rust WASM applications using Trunk.\nConclusion\nI am quite excited and optimistic about Rust's future with WebAssembly. WebAssembly has a long way to go, but it has already come so far. Working together to continue making Rust the best option for WebAssembly, and to ship more safe, robust, and powerful Rust code to the web is definitely for the better as far as I can see.\nBONUS: head on over to the next blog post where we discuss design patterns around a Trunk plugin system.\nLet's keep on doing this. Cheers!\n","id":"https://trunkrs.dev/blog/release-0-8-0/","title":"Trunk v0.8.0 & Project Update"},"https://trunkrs.dev/blog/release-0-9-0/":{"body":"Hello fellow Rustaceans! As you may know, Trunk is a WASM web application bundler for Rust. It works out of the box with any web UI framework based on wasm-bindgen, and supports bundling of a good number of asset types including SASS/SCSS, CSS, JS snippets, images, and more.\nI'm happy to announce the release of Trunk v0.9.0. There are two major items to highlight here, let's dig in.\nWebSocket Proxy for Dev Server\nFirst, shoutout to hamza1311 for all of their work trailblazing this feature within Trunk, and also a shoutout to jbg for their work on tide-websockets, which is what we are using to power our new WebSocket proxy system.\nThe new WebSocket proxy is identical in structure to the way standard HTTP proxies are declared. On the CLI — where only one proxy can be declared – simply add the new --proxy-ws flag to enable WebSocket proxy mode.\nIn a Trunk.toml file — where multiple proxies may be declared — simply add the ws = true field to a proxy section to turn it into a WebSocket proxy, as such:\n[[proxy]]\nbackend = \"ws://localhost:9000/api/ws\"\nws = true\nIntegration with wasm-opt\nShoutout to dnaka91 for all of the work on this one. More details on wasm-opt itself can be found in the WebAssembly/binaryen repo.\nTrunk now has an awesome integration with wasm-opt. In your index.html file, simply add the data-wasm-opt={level} attribute to your &lt;link data-trunk rel=\"rust\" .../&gt; as described here in the docs. The opt level can be any of the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, s or z where 0 explicitly disables wasm-opt.\nFor now, wasm-opt will need to be manually installed on your system if you are planning on using it with Trunk. We already have an issue scoping out the work for automatically installing wasm-opt (along with wasm-bindgen-cli as well). This will come in a future release.\nAs of this release, the default opt level is 0, effectively disabling wasm-opt. This is primarily to maintain backwards compatibility given the fact that we do not yet automatically install wasm-opt. After we've finished the work for automatic installation of wasm-opt, we will quite likely set the default to something between 2 &amp; 4.\nConclusion\nThe integration with wasm-opt was a blocker keeping some folks back from using Trunk (though it never precluded manual use of wasm-opt). Now that integration has landed, hopefully Trunk will be able to help more folks on their journey with Rust &amp; WebAssembly.\nOur new WebSocket support is also a major step forward for Trunk. WebSocket proxy support is a common need for folks building web applications, so being able to support this use case is a great step forward for the maturity of Trunk.\nAs community member lukechu10 has pointed out, creating our own UI error overlay to communicate errors coming from the Trunk build system is now an option for us to pursue. Automatic UI reloading, WASM HMR (I hope), and an integrated UI error overlay are all excellent features for us to hack on next!\nI'm stoked, let's continue to push this thing forward! If you are interested in getting involved, drop by our Discord server and say hello.\nCheers!\n","id":"https://trunkrs.dev/blog/release-0-9-0/","title":"Trunk v0.9.0"},"https://trunkrs.dev/blog/v10-v13/":{"body":"Hello fellow Rustaceans! It's been quite some time since our last blog post. We've seen 5 releases since then, so we've got a lot to cover.\nAutomatic Tool Downloads\nAfter building wasm-opt integration for Trunk, dnaka91 then built a system which is able to automatically download and install wasm-bindgen &amp; wasm-opt if they are missing from the host system. This system will check the version of wasm-bindgen being used by the parent application and will ensure that the versions match. External tools downloaded by this system are cached in a well-defined location based on the host OS.\nOverall this feature lowers the barrier of entry for getting started with Trunk. It was quite common that folks in the community discord would drop in with an error message indicating that Trunk was not able to call wasm-bindgen (the error message was not so great). Now, such issues should be a thing of the past.\nThere is a lot of great potential with this feature. There has been some good discussion in the community around moving away from our current sass solution, which is to link to a C-based sass lib, and instead to use our new download system to pull down dart-sass. This is the primary sass implementation these days, getting all of the new features before any of the other implementations. More design work to be done here, but this could be a big win.\nNot only does this apply to sass, but this could apply to any other integrations we build in the future. Especially in cases where the integration is a standalone binary which we can download and call. This will quite likely be an important piece of our plugin system once the plugin system is ready for prime time.\nTokio &amp; Axum\nTrunk has shipped with a static file server from the beginning. Somewhere along the way we added support for HTTP proxies, and then WebSocket proxies after that. Originally, Trunk was based on the async-std runtime, so we used tide for all things HTTP.\nThe Rust community evolves quickly. The async runtime ecosystem, even faster. Not long ago, the Tokio team released Tokio 1.0. This was a big win for the Rust ecosystem overall. Since then, they've continued to crank out new 1.x releases, along with new support libraries, io_uring support (love it), as well as a new server framework called Axum (blog post).\nAll that to say, I decided to cut Trunk over to the Tokio ecosystem, and while I was in the middle finishing up that work, I found myself wishing that we had a nice, simple, ergonomic web framework for Tokio ... and then literally the very next day Axum was released. This couldn't have come at a better time. Axum is built on Hyper &amp; Tower, so it has direct interoperability with that entire ecosystem. This made the switch rather simple on the Trunk side.\nI have to say, I'm quite stoked. Very happy with how this turned out for Trunk, and happy to see this new option come about for the Rust ecosystem. The wins here are obvious, but the biggest win is that we have a greater stability guarantee overall, and the success of the Tokio ecosystem to draw from.\nOther Features &amp; Fixes\nLots of big wins so far, but these last few releases have also seen many other smaller features and fixes. Let's take a look.\nindicatif\nAfter sinking more time than I care to admit, and finding myself frustrated rather often with indicatif, I decided to completely remove it from Trunk. Now, to be sure, indicatif is great, and its maintainer is quite literally a hero among the greater software community, but the difficulties I ran into here seemed to be more closely related to async interop.\nWithout going into too many details, deadlocks from progress bars, consoles not clearing properly, inflexibility of design, all of these things were causing me to spend more time on the console than spending time building other real features for Trunk. So, I decided to instead just use the good ol' tracing crate, and now things are quite stable.\nTruth be told, I would love to circle back at some point in the future and add a nicer console UI to Trunk. This is currently fairly low priority for me, as this is purely aesthetic. If you are passionate about such things, drop by our community discord and let us know!\nThere are many other features and fixes of note. Have a look at the changelog for more details.\nConclusion\nAll in all, some great progress for Trunk. As far as Trunk's future, the plugin system and exploring patterns around code splitting and HMR are the things I'm most excited about.\nAs a community, building web apps in Rust, finding the pain points, and then working together to fix them, that is how we make progress. Let's keep on pushing forward!\nCheers!\n","id":"https://trunkrs.dev/blog/v10-v13/","title":"Trunk v0.10 – v0.13"},"https://trunkrs.dev/commands/":{"body":"Trunk ships with a set of CLI commands to help you in your development workflows.\nbuild\ntrunk build runs a cargo build targeting the wasm32 instruction set, runs wasm-bindgen on the built WASM, and spawns asset build pipelines for any assets defined in the target index.html.\nTrunk leverages Rust's powerful concurrency primitives for maximum build speeds &amp; throughput.\nwatch\ntrunk watch does the same thing as trunk build, but also watches the filesystem for changes, triggering new builds as changes are detected.\nserve\ntrunk serve does the same thing as trunk watch, but also spawns a web server.\nclean\ntrunk clean cleans up any build artifacts generated from earlier builds.\nconfig show\ntrunk config show prints out Trunk's current config, before factoring in CLI arguments.

At the base, a config file can encapsulate project specific defaults, paths, ports and other config. Environment variables can be used to overwrite config file values. Lastly, CLI arguments / options take final precedence.\nTrunk.toml\nTrunk supports an optional Trunk.toml config file. An example config file is included in the Trunk repo, and shows all available config options along with their default values. By default, Trunk will look for a Trunk.toml config file in the current working directory. Trunk supports the global --config option to specify an alternative location for the file.\nNote that any relative paths declared in a Trunk.toml file will be treated as being relative to the Trunk.toml file itself.\nEnvironment Variables\nTrunk environment variables mirror the Trunk.toml config schema. All Trunk environment variables have the following 3 part form TRUNK_&lt;SECTION&gt;_&lt;ITEM&gt;, where TRUNK_ is the required prefix, &lt;SECTION&gt; is one of the Trunk.toml sections, and &lt;ITEM&gt; is a specific configuration item from the corresponding section. E.G., TRUNK_SERVE_PORT=80 will cause trunk serve to listen on port 80. The equivalent CLI invocation would be trunk serve --port=80.\nCLI Arguments &amp; Options\nThe final configuration layer is the CLI itself. Any arguments / options provided on the CLI will take final precedence over any other config layer.\nProxy\nTrunk ships with a built-in proxy which can be enabled when running trunk serve. There are two ways to configure the proxy, each discussed below. All Trunk proxies will transparently pass along the request body, headers, and query parameters to the proxy backend.\nProxy CLI Flags\nThe trunk serve command accepts two proxy related flags.\n--proxy-backend specifies the URL of the backend server to which requests should be proxied. The URI segment of the given URL will be used as the path on the Trunk server to handle proxy requests. E.G., trunk serve --proxy-backend=http://localhost:9000/api/ will proxy any requests received on the path /api/ to the server listening at http://localhost:9000/api/. Further path segments or query parameters will be seamlessly passed along.\n--proxy-rewrite specifies an alternative URI on which the Trunk server is to listen for proxy requests. Any requests received on the given URI will be rewritten to match the URI of the proxy backend, effectively stripping the rewrite prefix. E.G., trunk serve --proxy-backend=http://localhost:9000/ --proxy-rewrite=/api/ will proxy any requests received on /api/ over to http://localhost:9000/ with the /api/ prefix stripped from the request, while everything following the /api/ prefix will be left unchanged.\n--proxy-ws specifies that the proxy is for a WebSocket endpoint.\nConfig File\nThe Trunk.toml config file accepts multiple [[proxy]] sections, which allows for multiple proxies to be configured. Each section requires at least the backend field, and optionally accepts the rewrite and ws fields, both corresponding to the --proxy-* CLI flags discussed above.\nAs it is with other Trunk config, a proxy declared via CLI will take final precedence and will cause any config file proxies to be ignored, even if there are multiple proxies declared in the config file.\nThe following is a snippet from the Trunk.toml file in the Trunk repo:\n[[proxy]]\nrewrite = \"/api/v1/\"\nbackend = \"http://localhost:9000/\"\n","id":"https://trunkrs.dev/configuration/","title":"Configuration"}},"docInfo":{"https://trunkrs.dev/":{"body":329,"title":1},"https://trunkrs.dev/assets/":{"body":950,"title":1},"https://trunkrs.dev/blog/":{"body":19,"title":1},"https://trunkrs.dev/blog/plugin-system/":{"body":896,"title":5},"https://trunkrs.dev/blog/release-0-8-0/":{"body":591,"title":4},"https://trunkrs.dev/blog/release-0-9-0/":{"body":327,"title":2},"https://trunkrs.dev/blog/v10-v13/":{"body":455,"title":3},"https://trunkrs.dev/commands/":{"body":95,"title":1},"https://trunkrs.dev/configuration/":{"body":334,"title":1}},"length":9},"lang":"English"};
