# Contributing

Anyone and everyone is welcome to contribute! Please review
the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document for more details. The best
way to get started is to find an open issue, and then start hacking on implementing it. Letting other folks know that
you are working on it, and sharing progress is a great approach. Open pull requests early and often, and please use
GitHub's draft pull request feature.
