## proxy
# Proxies are optional, and default to `None`.
# Proxies are only run as part of the `trunk serve` command.

[[proxy]]
# This proxy example has a backend and a rewrite field. Requests received on `rewrite` will be
# proxied to the backend after rewriting the `rewrite` prefix to the `backend`'s URI prefix.
# E.G., `/api/v1/resource/x/y/z` -> `/resource/x/y/z`
rewrite = "/api/v1/"
backend = "http://localhost:9000/"

[[proxy]]
# This proxy specifies only the backend, which is the only required field. In this example,
# request URIs are not modified when proxied.
backend = "http://localhost:9000/api/v2/"
