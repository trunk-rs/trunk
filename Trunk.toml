## proxy
# Proxies are optional, and default to `None`.

# This hook example shows running a command inside a shell. As a result, features such as variable
# interpolation are available. This shows the TRUNK_STAGING_DIR environment variable, one of a set
# of default variables that Trunk inserts into your hook's environment. Additionally, this hook
# uses the build stage, meaning it executes in parallel with all of the existing asset pipelines.

[[hooks]]
# This hook example shows how command_arguments defaults to an empty list when absent. It also uses
# the post_build stage, meaning it executes after the rest of the build is complete, just before
# the staging directory is copied over the dist directory. This means that it has access to all
# built assets, including the HTML file generated by trunk.
