Trunk | cargo-manifest
=========================
An example application demonstrating building a vanilla Rust (no frameworks) WASM web application having the
configuration in the `Cargo.toml` file instead.

Once you've installed Trunk, simply execute `trunk serve --open` from this example's directory, and you should see the
web application rendered in your browser.
